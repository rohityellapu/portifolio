                My Story
            </h2>
            <p >I always wondered about knowing the point and purpose of study since my childhood.
                As I grew up, the study of Internet and Technology somehow constantly impressed me.  As a self-taught learner, I started learning to code online as it helped me to find my niche.

                Being a Math geek, I loved solving problems which involve logical and analytical thinking and made me
                great at understanding Data Structures and Algorithms. While digging more and more into tech world
                I get to know my real passion and decided to persue my career in Web Programming.
                My passion for coding never stopped.
                For a kick-start I enrolled into a professional program CS50x Introduction to Computer Science from Harvard University
                taught by David J. Malan. It helped me in acing at fundamentals of programming and diving deep into coding pool. To fill the gaps in my Web Developing career I joined a Full Stack Development Bootcamp on 10x
                Academy. They helped me to work on real-world projects with big tech industry-level experts.

                Currently, I am working as a Full Stack Developer in OpsVeda Asia Private Limited, enhancing my knowledge where businesses marries technology. Constantly contributing my compelling skills
                and enhance my career in Web programming. I have worked with industry level
                team at enterprises level projects. My passion of stretching myself in technologies never stops and always be looking for new oppurtunities and new challenges.
