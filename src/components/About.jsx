                As I grew up, the study of Internet and Technology somehow constantly impressed me.  As a self-taught learner, I started learning to code online as it helped me to find my niche.

                Being a Math geek, I loved solving problems which involve logical and analytical thinking and made me
                great at understanding Data Structures and Algorithms. While digging more and more into tech world
                I get to know my real passion and decided to persue my career in Web Programming. 
                Due to my personal, financial problems and false influences I couldn't persue a CS degree, but my passion for coding never stopped.
                For a kick-start I enrolled into a professional program CS50x Introduction to Computer Science from Harvard University 
                taught by David J. Malan. It helped me in acing at fundamentals of programming and diving deep into coding pool. To fill the gaps in my Web Developing career I joined a Full Stack Development Bootcamp on 10x 
                Academy. They helped me to work on real-world projects with big tech industry-level experts.

                Currently, I'm looking for a Junior Web Developer position where I can contribute my compelling skills 
                and enhance my career in Web programming. I  recently worked on MERN Stack Development and built industry level
                 team and personal projects.
